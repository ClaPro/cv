          This project was almost published as a scientific paper but due to cooperation issues i had to cancel it.

          This project was made for the course called "Language Technology". The main idea behind the work described is that social media are able to provide large datasets which can be helpful in identifying certain patterns that may occur in social media text, and in helping to automatically reveal cases of virus infections. My constribution to this project was:
          - Collected Tweets and assign then to my associates so they label them as true or false
          - Used SMOTE to bring balance dataset
          - Applied machine learning algoriths on the data
          - Created a bidirectional recurrent neural network
          - Trained the bidirectional recurrent neural network using 10-fold cross validation
          - Created the GitHub repository

          The idea was to learn through this project but the result was amazing.

          This project was made for the course called "Entertainment Technology Software and Virtual Worlds". We were asked to build any game we like and i choose to implement Pac-Man using Vanilla JavaScript in order to master the fundumentals of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I am very proud of the result as it is not a casual Pac-Man implementation. I have even managed to sell a version of this game on fiverr.com.
