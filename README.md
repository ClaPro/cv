- Additional Code made by me(no pr send):
      - Animated Background with CSS
      - Skills sections with bars that read the data from _config.yml that i formated (new content -> skill for which i added an html) and with javascript the bar gets filled. For example for 7/10 python skill the bar gets filled accoredingly and automatically.
      - Font change and font shadow
      - More buttons with additional icon
      - Used git hooks for automatical re-creation of a pdf file of the resume. For more details visit this short [clip](https://asciinema.org/a/412412) where these get demonstrated.
